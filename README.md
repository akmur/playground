# Playground

A starter HTML/JS/SASS kit with linters and a web server to be used with VS code.

Just run npm install to install sass and js linters and a local web server.
Run "npm run dev" to start the server.
In order to compile sass and use stylelint and standard properly, you need to rely on your text editor's extensions.
