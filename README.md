# Playground

A starter HTML/JS/React/SASS kit with linters and Parcel bundler.

The packages you need in your editor (I use VS Code) are:

- Prettier
- stylelint
- ESlint

Just run npm install to install sass and js linters, React and Parcel.
Run "npm run dev" to start the server.

In order to compile sass and use stylelint and prettier properly, you need to rely on your text editor's extensions.
